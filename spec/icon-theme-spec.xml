    <para>
    An icon theme is a set of icons that share a common look and
    feel. The user can then select the icon theme that they want to
    use, and all apps use icons from the theme. The initial user of
    icon themes is the icon field of the desktop file specification,
    but in the future it can have other uses (such as mimetype
    icons).
    </para>
    <para>
    From a programmer perspective an icon theme is just a
    mapping. Given a set of directories to look for icons in and a theme
    name it maps from icon name and nominal icon size to an icon filename.

          An icon theme is a named set of icons. It is used to map
          from an iconname and size to a file. Themes may inherit
          from other themes as a way to extend them.

	<listitem>
	  <para>
          An icon file is an image that can be loaded and used as an
          icon. The supported image file formats are PNG, XPM and SVG.
          PNG is the recommended bitmap format, and SVG is for
          vectorized icons. XPM is supported due to backwards
          compability reasons, and it is not recommended that new
          themes use XPM files. Support for SVGs is optional.

	<listitem>
	  <para>
          Icons and themes are searched for in a set of directories,
          called base directories. The themes are stored in
          subdirectories of the base directories.

  <sect1 id="directory_layout">
    <title>Directory Layout</title>
    <para>
    Icons and themes are looked for in a set of directories. By
    default, apps should look in $HOME/.icons (for backwards compatibility),
    in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/icons and in /usr/share/pixmaps (in that order).
    Applications may further add
    their own icon directories to this list, and users may extend or
    change the list (in application/desktop specific ways).In each of
    these directories themes are stored as subdirectories. A theme can
    be spread across several base directories by having subdirectories of
    the same name. This way users can extend and override system 
    themes. 
    </para>
    <para>
    In order to have a place for third party applications to install
    their icons there should always exist a theme called "hicolor"
    <footnote><para>This name is chosen for backwards compatibility with the old
    KDE default theme</para></footnote>.
    The data for the hicolor theme is available for download at:
    http://www.freedesktop.org/software/icon-theme/.
    Implementations are required to look in the "hicolor" theme if
    an icon was not found in the current theme.
    </para>
    <para>
    Each theme is stored as subdirectories of the base
    directories. The internal name of the theme is the name of the
    subdirectory, although the user-visible name as specified by the
    theme may be different. Hence, theme names are case sensitive, and
    are limited to ASCII characters. Theme names may also not contain
    comma or space.
    </para>
    <para>
    In at least one of the theme directories there must be a file
    called index.theme that describes the theme. The first index.theme
    found while searching the base directories in order is used. This
    file describes the general attributes of the theme.
    </para>
    <para>
    In the theme directory are also a set of subdirectories containing
    image files. Each directory contains icons designed for a certain
    nominal icon size, as described by the index.theme file. The
    subdirectories are allowed to be several levels deep, e.g. the
    subdirectory "48x48/apps" in the theme "hicolor" would end up at
    $basedir/hicolor/48x48/apps.
    </para>
    <para>
    The image files must be one of the types: PNG, XPM, or SVG, and
    the extension must be ".png", ".xpm", or ".svg" (lower case). The
    support for SVG files is optional. Implementations that do not
    support SVGs should just ignore any ".svg" files. In
    addition to this there may be an additional file with extra
    icon-data for each file. It should have the same basename as the
    image file, with the extension ".icon". e.g. if the icon file is
    called "mime_source_c.png" the corresponding file would be named
    "mime_source_c.icon".
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="file_formats">
    <title>File Formats</title>
    <para>
    Both the icon theme description file and the icon data files are
    ini-style text files, as described in the desktop file
    specification. They don't have any encoding field. Instead, they 
    must always be stored in UTF-8 encoding.
    </para>
    <para>
    The index.theme file must start with a section called <citetitle>Icon
    Theme</citetitle>, with contents according to table 1 below. All lists are
    comma-separated.

  <sect1 id="icon_lookup">
    <title>Icon Lookup</title>
    <para>
    The icon lookup mechanism has two global settings, the list of
    base directories and the internal name of the current theme. Given
    these we need to specify how to look up an icon file from the icon
    name and the nominal size.
    </para>
    <para>
    The lookup is done first in the current theme, and then
    recursively in each of the current theme's parents, and
    finally in the default theme called "hicolor" (implementations may
    add more default themes before "hicolor", but "hicolor" must be
    last). As soon as there is an icon of any size that matches in a
    theme, the search is stopped. Even if there may be an icon with a
    size closer to the correct one in an inherited theme, we don't want
    to use it. Doing so may generate an inconsistant change in an icon
    when you change icon sizes (e.g. zoom in).
    </para>
    <para>
    The lookup inside a theme is done in three phases. First all the
    directories are scanned for an exact match, e.g. one where the
    allowed size of the icon files match what was looked up. Then all
    the directories are scanned for any icon that matches the name. If
    that fails we finally fall back on unthemed icons. If we fail to
    find any icon at all it is up to the application to pick a good
    fallback, as the correct choice depends on the context.
    </para>
    <para>
    The exact algorithm (in pseudocode) for looking up an icon in a theme
    (if the implementation supports SVG) is:
    <programlisting>
FindIcon(icon, size) {
  filename = FindIconHelper(icon, size, user selected theme);
  if filename != none
    return filename

  filename = FindIconHelper(icon, size, "hicolor");
  if filename != none
    return filename

  return LookupFallbackIcon (icon)
}
FindIconHelper(icon, size, theme) {
  filename = LookupIcon (icon, size, theme)
  if filename != none
    return filename

  if theme has parents
    parents = theme.parents

  for parent in parents {
    filename = FindIconHelper (icon, size, parent)
    if filename != none
      return filename
  }
  return none
}
     </programlisting>
     With the following helper functions:
     <programlisting>
LookupIcon (iconname, size, theme) {
  for each subdir in $(theme subdir list) {
    for each directory in $(basename list) {
      for extension in ("png", "svg", "xpm") {
        if DirectoryMatchesSize(subdir, size) {
          filename = directory/$(themename)/subdir/iconname.extension
          if exist filename
	    return filename
        }
      }
    }
  }
  minimal_size = MAXINT
  for each subdir in $(theme subdir list) {
    for each directory in $(basename list) {
      for extension in ("png", "svg", "xpm") {
        filename = directory/$(themename)/subdir/iconname.extension
        if exist filename and DirectorySizeDistance(subdir, size) &lt; minimal_size {
	   closest_filename = filename
	   minimal_size = DirectorySizeDistance(subdir, size)
        }
      }
    }
  }
  if closest_filename set
     return closest_filename
  return none
}

LookupFallbackIcon (iconname) {
  for each directory in $(basename list) {
    for extension in ("png", "svg", "xpm") {
      if exists directory/iconname.extension
        return directory/iconname.extension
    }
  }
  return none
}

DirectoryMatchesSize(subdir, iconsize) {
  read Type and size data from subdir
  if Type is Fixed
    return Size == iconsize
  if Type is Scaled
    return MinSize &lt;= iconsize &lt;= MaxSize
  if Type is Threshold
    return Size - Threshold &lt;= iconsize &lt;= Size + Threshold
}

DirectorySizeDistance(subdir, size) {
  read Type and size data from subdir
  if Type is Fixed
    return abs(Size - iconsize)
  if Type is Scaled
    if iconsize &lt; MinSize
        return MinSize - iconsize
    if iconsize &gt; MaxSize
        return iconsize - MaxSize
    return 0
  if Type is Threshold
    if iconsize &lt; Size - Threshold
        return MinSize - iconsize
    if iconsize &gt; Size + Threshold
        return iconsize - MaxSize
    return 0
}
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
    In some cases you don't always want to fall back to an icon in an
    inherited theme. For instance, sometimes you look for a set of
    icons, prefering any of them before using an icon from an inherited
    theme. To support such operations implementations can contain a
    function that finds the first of a list of icon names in the inheritance
    hierarchy. I.E. It would look something like this:
<programlisting>
FindBestIcon(iconList, size) {
  filename = FindBestIconHelper(iconList, size, user selected theme);
  if filename != none
    return filename

  filename = FindBestIconHelper(iconList, size, "hicolor");
  if filename != none
    return filename

  for icon in iconList {
    filename = LookupFallbackIcon (icon)
    if filename != none
      return filename
  }
  return none;
}
FindBestIconHelper(iconList, size, theme) {
  for icon in iconList {
    filename = LookupIcon (icon, size, theme)
    if filename != none
      return filename
  }

  if theme has parents
    parents = theme.parents

  for parent in parents {
    filename = FindBestIconHelper (iconList, size, parent)
    if filename != none
      return filename
  }
  return none
}
</programlisting>
    This can be very useful for example when handling mimetype icons, where there
    are more and less "specific" versions of icons.

     The corresponding directory tree in the /usr/share/icons
     directory could look like this:
     <programlisting>birch/index.theme
birch/scalable/apps/mozilla.svg
birch/scalable/mimetypes/mime_text_plain.svg
birch/scalable/mimetypes/mime_text_plain.icon
birch/48x48/apps/mozilla.png
birch/32x32/apps/mozilla.png
birch/48x48/mimetypes/mime_text_plain.png
birch/48x48/mimetypes/mime_text_plain.icon</programlisting>
Where birch/scalable/mimetypes/mime_text_plain.icon contains:
     <programlisting>[Icon Data]
DisplayName=Mime text/plain
EmbeddedTextRectangle=100,100,900,900
AttachPoints=200,200|800,200|500,500|200,800|800,800</programlisting>
And birch/48x48/mimetypes/mime_text_plain.icon contains:
     <programlisting>[Icon Data]
DisplayName=Mime text/plain
EmbeddedTextRectangle=8,8,40,40
AttachPoints=20,20|40,40|50,10|10,50</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
    In this example a lookup of "mozilla" would get the prerendered
    48x48 and 32x32 icons before the SVG icons due to the order of
    Directories.

    <title>Installing Application Icons</title>
    <para>
    So, you're an application author, and want to install application icons
    so that they work in the KDE and Gnome menus. Minimally you should install
    a 48x48 icon in the hicolor theme. This means installing a PNG file in
    $prefix/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps. Optionally you can install icons in different
    sizes. For example, installing a svg icon in $prefix/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps
    means most desktops will have one icon that works for all sizes. You might even want to
    install icons with a look that matches other well known themes so your application
    will fit in with some specific desktop environment. 
    </para>
    <para>
    It is recommended that the icons installed in the hicolor theme look neutral,
    since it is a fallback theme that will be used in combination with some very
    different looking themes. But if you don't have any neutral icon, please install
    whatever icon you have in the hicolor theme so that all applications get at
    least some icon in all themes.

    The algorithm as described in this document works by always
    looking up filenames in directories (a stat in unix
    terminology). A good implementation is expected to read the
    directories once, and do all lookups in memory using that
    information.
    </para>
    <para>
    This caching can make it impossible for users to add icons without
    having to restart applications. In order to handle this, any
    implementation that does caching is required to look at the mtime
    of the toplevel icon directories when doing a cache lookup, unless
    it already did so less than 5 seconds ago. This means that any
    icon editor or theme installation program need only to change the
    mtime of the the toplevel directory where it changed the theme to
    make sure that the new icons will eventually get used.

    The icon theme specification is based on the original
    KDE icon theme system designed by Antonio Larossa,
    Geert Janssen and Torsten Rahn. The common specification
    mostly adds support for .icon files, renames the icon theme
    description files and removes a few references to kde in them.
